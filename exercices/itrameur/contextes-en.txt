   robot
   The quadrupedal military robot Cheetah, an evolution of BigDog
   (pictured), was clocked as the world's fastest legged robot in 2012,
   beating the record set by an MIT bipedal robot in 1989.^[1]

   A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable
   of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.^[2] A robot
   can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be
   embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but
   most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on
   stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.

   TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical
   operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots,
   collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General
   Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a
   lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense
   of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected
   to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car
   as some of the main drivers.^[3]

   The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction,
   operation, and application of robots,^[4] as well as computer systems
   for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is
   robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take
   the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing
   processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition.
   Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field
   of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch
   of robotics: soft robotics.

Early robots

--

   In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots, Eric, was exhibited at the
   annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London, where it
   delivered a speech. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot's frame
   consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and
   one motor powered by a twelve-volt power source. The robot could move
   its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or
--
   cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on
   and off. In 1939, the humanoid robot known as Elektro was debuted at
   the 1939 New York World's Fair.^[52]^[53] Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and

   gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. In 1928,
   Japan's first robot, Gakutensoku, was designed and constructed by
   biologist Makoto Nishimura.

Modern autonomous robots

   The first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were
   created by William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at
--
   very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain
   worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and
   Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described
   as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The
   three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they
   could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on
--
   processes in terms of digital computation. His work inspired subsequent
   generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec
   and Mark Tilden. Modern incarnations of Walter's turtles may be found
   in the form of BEAM robotics.^[54]
   U.S. Patent 2,988,237, issued in 1961 to Devol.

   The first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by
   George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate. This
   ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry.^[55]
   Devol sold the first Unimate to General Motors in 1960, and it was
--
   of metal from a die casting machine and stack them.^[56] Devol's patent
   for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents
   the foundation of the modern robotics industry.^[57]

   The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki
   Kogyo Company.^[58] In 1973, a robot with six electromechanically
   driven axes was patented^[59]^[60]^[61] by KUKA robotics in Germany,
   and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by Victor
--

   Commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing
   jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans.
--

   Various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and
   robots. One method is evolutionary robotics, in which a number of
   differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which perform best are
   used as a model to create a subsequent "generation" of robots. Another
   method is developmental robotics, which tracks changes and development
   within a single robot in the areas of problem-solving and other
   functions. Another new type of robot is just recently introduced which
   acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named RoboHon.^[63]

   As robots become more advanced, eventually there may be a standard
   computer operating system designed mainly for robots. Robot Operating
   System is an open-source set of programs being developed at Stanford
--
   University of Munich, Germany, among others. ROS provides ways to
   program a robot's navigation and limbs regardless of the specific
   hardware involved. It also provides high-level commands for items like
   image recognition and even opening doors. When ROS boots up on a
   robot's computer, it would obtain data on attributes such as the length
   and movement of robots' limbs. It would relay this data to higher-level
   algorithms. Microsoft is also developing a "Windows for robots" system
   with its Robotics Developer Studio, which has been available since

  Modular robot

   Main article: Self-reconfiguring modular robot

   Modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase
   the use of robots by modularizing their architecture.^[95] The
   functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to
   increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of
   a single type of identical, several different identical module types,
   or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural
   structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be
   designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the
   programming, inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more
   complex than with traditional robots. Modular robots may be composed of
   L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT
   technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics
   Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U and H shaped
   modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and
   homogenous modular robot systems. These "ANAT robots" can be designed
   with "n" DOF as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that
   folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its
--
   strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules
   do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot
   to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached
   modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as
   the length of the arm increases. Modular robots can be manually or
   self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different
   applications. Because modular robots of the same architecture type are
   composed of modules that compose different modular robots, a snake-arm
   robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra-arm robot, or
   can split into several mobile robots, and mobile robots can split into
   multiple smaller ones, or combine with others into a larger or
   different one. This allows a single modular robot the ability to be
   fully specialized in a single task, as well as the capacity to be

   military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of
   autonomous functions.^[120] There are also concerns about technology
   which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other
   robots.^[121] The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that, as
   military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention

   See also: List of robots

   At present, there are two main types of robots, based on their use:
   general-purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots.

   Robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose. A robot might
   be designed to perform one particular task extremely well, or a range
   of tasks less well. All robots by their nature can be re-programmed to
   behave differently, but some are limited by their physical form. For
   example, a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting, welding,
   gluing, or acting as a fairground ride, while a pick-and-place robot
   can only populate printed circuit boards.

  General-purpose autonomous robots

   Main article: Autonomous robot

   General-purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions
   independently. General-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate
   independently in known spaces, handle their own re-charging needs,
   interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic
   tasks. Like computers, general-purpose robots can link with networks,
   software and accessories that increase their usefulness. They may
--
   environmental quality, respond to alarms, pick up supplies and perform
   other useful tasks. General-purpose robots may perform a variety of
   functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at
   different times of day. Some such robots try to mimic human beings and
   may even resemble people in appearance; this type of robot is called a
   humanoid robot. Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage, as
   no humanoid robot can, as of yet, actually navigate around a room that
   it has never been in.^[citation needed] Thus, humanoid robots are
   really quite limited, despite their intelligent behaviors in their
--

  Factory robots

--
   Over the last three decades, automobile factories have become dominated
   by robots. A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots
   working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every
   ten human workers. On an automated production line, a vehicle chassis
   on a conveyor is welded, glued, painted and finally assembled at a
   sequence of robot stations.

--

   Industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and
   packaging of manufactured goods, for example for rapidly taking drink
--
   Mass-produced printed circuit boards (PCBs) are almost exclusively
   manufactured by pick-and-place robots, typically with SCARA
   manipulators, which remove tiny electronic components from strips or
   trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.^[137] Such robots
   can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour, far

   Almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a
   robot.^[149]^[150] Some were launched in the 1960s with very limited
   abilities, but their ability to fly and land (in the case of Luna 9) is
   an indication of their status as a robot. This includes the Voyager
   probes and the Galileo probes, among others.

    Telerobots

   A U.S. Marine Corps technician prepares to use a telerobot to detonate
   a buried improvised explosive device near Camp Fallujah, Iraq.

   Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices remotely operated from
   a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined
--
   are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job
   because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in
   another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to
   the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the
   surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale
--
   tight spaces such as in duct cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the

    Domestic robots

   The Roomba domestic vacuum cleaner robot does a single, menial job

   Domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in
   home use. They are used in simple but often disliked jobs, such as
   vacuum cleaning, floor washing, and lawn mowing. An example of a
   domestic robot is a Roomba.

  Military robots

   Main article: Military robot

   Military robots include the SWORDS robot which is currently used in
   ground-based combat. It can use a variety of weapons and there is some
--
   effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.^[162] Several such
   measures reportedly already exist, with robot-heavy countries such as
   Japan and South Korea^[163] having begun to pass regulations requiring
   robots to be equipped with safety systems, and possibly sets of 'laws'
   akin to Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.^[164]^[165] An official report

   referred to as "Robot Legal Studies."^[167] Some concern has been
   expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent
   falsehoods.^[168]

  Research robots

--

   While most robots today are installed in factories or homes, performing
   labour or life saving jobs, many new types of robot are being developed
   in laboratories around the world. Much of the research in robotics
   focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into
   new types of robot, alternative ways to think about or design robots,
   and new ways to manufacture them. It is expected that these new types
   of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are
   finally realized.^[citation needed]

    Reconfigurable robots

   Main article: Self-reconfiguring modular robot

   A few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots
   which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task,^[185]
   like the fictional T-1000. Real robots are nowhere near that
   sophisticated however, and mostly consist of a small number of cube
   shaped units, which can move relative to their neighbours. Algorithms
   have been designed in case any such robots become a reality.^[186]

    Swarm robots

   Main article: Swarm robotics

   Inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees, researchers are
   modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which
   together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden,
   cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent
   behavior of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots can be
   considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant

   swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project^[192] and the Open-source
   Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research
   collective behaviors.^[193]^[194] Swarms are also more resistant to
   failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm
   can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them
   attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally

   Asimov is probably best remembered for his science-fiction stories and
   especially those about robots, where he placed robots and their
   interaction with society at the center of many of his
   works.^[201]^[202] Asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal
   set of instructions robots might be given to lower the risk to humans,
   and arrived at his Three Laws of Robotics: a robot may not injure a
   human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm;
   a robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such
   orders would conflict with the First Law; and a robot must protect its
   own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the
--
   story "Runaround", although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories.
   Later, Asimov added the Zeroth Law: "A robot may not harm humanity, or,
   by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm"; the rest of the laws are

   Asimov's short story "Liar!" (1941) that mentions the First Law is the
   earliest recorded use of the word robotics. Asimov was not initially

   The concept of humanoid sex robots has drawn public attention and
   elicited debate regarding their supposed benefits and potential effects
--
   Italian movie The Mechanical Man (1921), the first film to have shown a
   battle between robots.

   Fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a
   wide range of books and films. A common theme is the development of a
   master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots, motivated to
   take over or destroy the human race. Frankenstein (1818), often called
   the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme
   of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator.

--
   in Battlestar Galactica, the Cybermen and Daleks in Doctor Who, The
   Matrix, Enthiran and I, Robot. Some fictional robots are programmed to
   kill and destroy; others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by
   upgrading their own software and hardware. Examples of popular media
   where the robot becomes evil are 2001: A Space Odyssey, Red Planet and
   Enthiran.

   The 2017 game Horizon Zero Dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare,
   robot ethics, and the AI control problem, as well as the positive or
   negative impact such technologies could have on the environment.
--
   Another common theme is the reaction, sometimes called the "uncanny
   valley", of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic
   humans too closely.^[107]
--
   More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent
   robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and
   the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for
   the robots themselves.
